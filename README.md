#### Note:

- The code for each task is located in the "data" folder under "tasks".
- A custom function(get_param) was implemented to read and process input data from the .json files.
- The mathematical optimization model was formulated using GurobiPy,
- focusing on maximizing profits while satisfying system constraints.
- After validating the model, multiple scenarios were generated and
- sensitivity analyses were conducted to evaluate the impact of varying key parameters.
- This workflow was consistently applied across all tasks in the project.
